# artifactrating

A artifact rating api works on cloudflare workers

## Disclaimer

_This rating system is for entertainment purposes only and should not be taken seriously as a measure of the actual performance of artifacts in the game. The rating system only accounts for single character combat and does not consider the following factors that can affect the outcome of real combat scenarios:_

1. Distance: The rating system assumes that all characters are in melee range of each other, which may not be the case in actual gameplay. Some characters may have an advantage or disadvantage depending on how far they are from their enemies.
2. Rotation: The rating system does not account for the order and timing of skill casting by different characters, which can have a significant impact on their damage output, survivability, and utility. Some characters may have synergies or conflicts with each other depending on their skill rotations.
3. Buffs: The rating system does not account for any additional buffs that can be applied by teammates or other external sources, such as food items, environmental effects, etc, with the exception of elemental resonance. These buffs can enhance or diminish the effectiveness of certain artifacts or characters.

_Moreover, some characters have more effective stats (i.e. benefit from wider range of stats). Therefore, characters with less effective stats will naturally find it harder to attain higher scores (e.g. Xiao vs Yelan)._

Therefore, this rating system should not be used as a definitive guide for choosing artifacts or building teams. It is merely a fun way to compare different artifact combinations and see how they affect a single character's combat potential. Please use your own judgment and experience when playing the game and enjoy it to the fullest!
